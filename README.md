# odin-rock-paper-scissors

### Assignment:
Create a rock, paper, scissors game.

### My goals:
Use what I've learnt about HTML, CSS and Javascript (and a bit of additional Googling) to make
a rock, paper, scissors game that is a bit more engaging than the usual set up.

A problem with these games are that the results are instans, which makes it a bit hard for the player
to follow along with. There are too many elements that change at the same time after the player makes 
a selection and sometimes there are a lot of text being presented after each round.

I tried solving this issue by having a slower flow in the gameplay. The player makes the selection, then 
the computer "spins the wheel" which gruadually slows down, giving a tad bit of suspense to it's selection.

The game clearly shows who is the winner, before awarding points and reseting the game.

The game has almost no text elements, just to keep it a bit simple. The ques are made from visuals and sounds.

I believe the game flows a bit better this way and it's a bit more fun to play, although it is still
rock, paper, scissors... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
